# Number Guessing Game

This is my first very small project using Java.

It's a very simple number guessing game.

The user picks a difficulty and then has a number of tries to try and guess the correct number with a little bit of higher/lower hints to help get there.

I then have played around with creating a .jar file with some pre-configuration settings in IntelliJ to allow it to be shareable and runnable (I think...)

So with that being said in cmd navigate to the repo and enter the following to play the game:

`java -jar NumberGuessingGame.jar`

P.S. if you need Java head to [https://dev.java/](https://dev.java/) to download the latest jdk
